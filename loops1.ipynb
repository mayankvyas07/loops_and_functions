    "Q1. When to use a for loop and a while loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "For Loop: Use a for loop when you know the number of iterations in advance or when you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, etc.). It's particularly useful for iterating over a known range or set of elements.\n",
    "While Loop: Use a while loop when you want to continue iterating as long as a specific condition is true. It's suitable for situations where you don't know the number of iterations in advance, and you want to keep repeating a block of code until a certain condition is met.\n",
